# The Library Management System

  As name suggests this project is about how to manage the books in the library by using simple oops concepts.
  Here I have used a text file to track the list of books. By using this txt file following operations of library management system will be monitered.
       
    display_books
    Issue_books
    add_books
    return_books
  
### 1. Add Books

    All the new books will be added to the text file using this function. The book id will be generated automatically. 
    The name of the books should not be more than 20 characters.
 ### 2. Issue Books
  
    The book will be issued based on the given book id. If we enter the book Id which is already issued, it will show 
    a messsage with name of lender and time of book issued. Once the book is issued the status will be changed to 
    "Already Issued".
### 3. Return Books
 
    To return the book we just need to enter the book id, then automatically the book status will be updated into "Available".
### 4. Display Books
  
    This function is used to display the list of the books along with the status.
